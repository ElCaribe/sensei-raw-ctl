sensei-raw-ctl

This program makes it possible to change the configuration of your SteelSeries
Sensei Raw mouse from within Linux, *BSD or any other POSIX-compatible system
supported by libusb.

Run `sensei-raw-ctl --help' or `man sensei-raw-ctl' for usage information.

If you don't fancy command line tools, there's also a basic GTK+ frontend
available.  On Ubuntu and its derivates, you should be able to find it in your
System Settings.

Installation
============
Build dependencies: cmake >= 2.8.5, help2man, libusb >= 1.0,
                    gtk+ >= 3.0 (optional)

$ git clone git://github.com/pjanouch/sensei-raw-ctl.git
$ cd sensei-raw-ctl
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
# make install

Note that there's no "make uninstall" and the GUI needs to be installed in the
right location to work correctly.

If you don't want the GUI frontend, append -DBUILD_GUI=NO to the cmake command.
The GUI also isn't going to be built if you don't have the GTK+ 3 development
packages installed, if your distribution has any.

For Debian-based distros, you can do the following instead of the last step:
$ cpack -G DEB
# dpkg -i sensei-raw-ctl-*.deb
